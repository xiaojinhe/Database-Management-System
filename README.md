# Database-Management-System
-	Implemented a miniature database system that supports declarative DSL (Domain Specific Language) like SQL from scratch using Java. 
-	It supports the commands: create tables, select and process information from tables based on conditions and operations, print tables, load tables from files, and store tables in files. 
- It is capable of handling malformed commands and illegal operations.
